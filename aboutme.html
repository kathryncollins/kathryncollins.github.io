  <p>Born December 1992, Kathryn has lived in California, Texas, Massachusetts, and Florida. She doesn't have an accent, but reserves the right to use "wicked" and "y'all" in the same breath.
    She's been a voracious reader and debater since approximately kindergarten, which initially prompted her parents to think they might have a future doctor or lawyer on their hands. Kathryn,
    being the attention-seeking, feminist child she was famously declared she wanted to be "an actress AND write biographies of famous ladies".</p>

  <p>Somewhere in high school, amidst some rather unsuccessful endeavors (including band, volleyball, drama, track, etc) she found the newspaper, the tv production class, and debate team. The rest
    as they say, is history.</p>
  <p>As she's grown (metaphorically and literally at 6'1), her irrepressible curiosity and love of story-telling have grown too. It is these qualities, along with a dogged determination to succeed
    and improve herself, that will undoubtedly be an asset to her future employers and colleagues. Her dream is to find a way to utilize her skills in this area to actually help others. She has
    a long way to go before attaining the sort of influence that would allow her to contribute to the greater good by sparking national dialogues or bringing awareness to particular issues.... but
    providing reliable, timely information to a local community would be a good start for this articulate and ambitious blonde.

  <h3>Personal</h3>
  <p>A self-professed nerd, Kathryn (also known to friends as Kat) enjoys books, travel, "Humans of New York", dogs, Netflix, time with her family,
    cheering on the Miami Hurricanes, Cape Cod, trivia, teaching her grandfather how to use "the google", J.Crew, and beaches.</p>
  <p>Kathryn's weaknesses? <del>None</del> Irish skin that sunburns a lovely lobster hue, terribly cheesy puns and wordplay, a tendency to
    get carried away in enthusiasm and overcommit, Chipotle, and the Red Sox.</p>
