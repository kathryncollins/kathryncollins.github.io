        <p>I was born December 1, 1992 in Southern California. The first child of Timothy and Patricia Collins.</p>
        <p>From 1995-2007, the family lived in a suburb of Houston, Texas. A second daughter, Colleen, and a puppy would join the family.</p>
        <p>Kathryn displayed an aptitude for reading and storytelling at an early age, according to her -admittedly biased- mother.</p>
        <p>In 2007, the Collins family decided to return to their roots in Boston. They currently reside there.</p>
        <p>In high school, Kathryn discovered the school paper, tv station, debate, and drama club. She's been trying to figure out a way to make money from telling interesting stories since then.</p>
